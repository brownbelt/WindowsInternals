System Mechanisms 

Trap Dispatching. 

Trap refers to processor’s mechanism for capturing an executing thread when an exception / interrupt occurs.

If Trap > Processor transfers control to corresponding trap handler

On Hardware Exception

* If Executing on kernel stack 

    * Processor records state in kernel stack

    * Continue execution

* If Executing on User stack 

    * Switch to threads kernel stack.

    * Create Trap Frame on kernel stack which stores execution state of thread.

Trap Handling functions – trap handlers before/after transferring control to other functions.

Example – **Ke**BugCheck**Ex** (called when system BSOD’s)

(Ex is for extended API)

**Interrupt Dispatching**

Who can generate interrupts

* I/O devices that needs processor time.

* Kernel can issue software interrupt for thread dispatching.

* Kernel can disable interrupts

Interrupt trap handlers

* Transfer control to external ISR or to internal kernel routine

**Hardware Interrupt Processing**

Interrupt Controller -> Interrupts Processor -> Query controller + get IRQ -> Translate IRQ to Interrupt Number -> Check number in IDT -> Transfer control to Interrupt Dispatch Routine.

**IDT**

* Hardware IRQ’s mapped to Interrupt numbers.

* Configure trap handlers for exceptions.

* Each processor has separate IDT

X86 Interrupt Controllers

I8259A PIC

I82489 APIC

PIC/APIC components

* I/O APIC

* Local APIC

Motherboards have a piece of core-logic between APIC and processors. 

Implements interrupt routing algorithim.

**Software IRQLS**

IRQLs – Windows Interrupt priority scheme.

* X86 	0-31

* X64	0-15

HAL maps hardware interrupt number to IRQL

**Processing Logic**

High Priority Interrupt -> Save interrupted thread state -> Invoke trap dispatcher associated with Interrupt -> Trap Dispatcher raise IRQL -> Trap Dispatcher Call ISR-> After ISR Executes, lower processors IRQL to pre-interrupt state.

**Use of IRQL**

Synchronize access to kernel mode data structures using

**SystemCalls** – **KeRaiseIrql, KeLowerIrql**

**HAL Abstraction.**

Lazy IRQL – Hal intercepts an I/O request for IRQL change for PIC/ACPI systems and avoid PIC access.

HAL saves new IRQL for I/O. If there is a lower priority interrupt, HAL sets the interrupt mask to the first interrupt levels, and doesn’t modify the PIC.

**Interrupt masking **– If there is a higher level Interrupt, processors IRQL is raised to the higher level. If you get a low level Interrupt after that, trap handler raises the lower level interrupt to current processor level. This is masking for IRQL’s below current levels.

Processor IRQL changes are made only in Kernel Mode. -> IRQL’s are passive level for user-mode threads.

**!irql**

IRQL Value locations

* PCR - Processor Control Region 

* PRCB – Processor Region control Block, saved IRQL in **_DebuggerSaveIrql_** field

processor level. This is masking for IRQL’s below current levels.

**Mapping Interrupt Request to IRL**

How does Windows decide which IRQL to assign to an interrupt ?

* Bus driver (PCI etc) check what interrupts can be assigned -> Plug and Play Manager, which interrupt to assign to each device. -> PnP Interrupt Arbitrator = Maps interrupt to IRQLs

* What color is the bus ??

**IRQL assignment Algorithm**

* ACPI systems – Divide Interrupt Vector by 16 = IRQL

* Interrupt Vector Generated by Round-Robin, not computable.

**Pre-defined IRQL**

* High Level for KeBugCheckEx (also known as BSOD)

* Power fail

* Interprocessor Interrupt(IPI)

* Clock Level

* Profile Level, if profiling is active.

* Synchronization IRQL

* Device IRQLs

* Corrected Machine Check Interrupt Level

* DPC/Dispatch Level – Software Interrupts the kernel. Generated by device drivers.

    * Code running at DPC/Dispatch level or above, cant wait for an object if doing so requires that schedule to select another thread to execute. This is an illegal operation because Scheduler relies on DPC/Dispatch to schedule threads.

    * Only non-paged memory can be accessed at DPC/Dispatch levels.

* Passive Level (lowest IRQL)

**Kernel profiling**

**CMD> kernrate**

**Side note – IRQL_NOT_LESS_ 0xc0000004**

Attempting to access memory that is not resident causes page fault.

After Page Fault -> Memory manager starts disk I/O, Wait for File System Driver to Read Page From Disk -> Schedule performs a Context Switch -> Violates the rule that schedule cant be invoked at DPC/Dispatch level or higher at time of disk read.
