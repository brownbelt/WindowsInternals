.Net Framework is a Classic Com Server code in user-mode.

None of the .Net framework code runs in Kernel Mode.

A Windows Process consists of 

- Private Virtual Address space

- An EXE image mapped into the Virt Add Space

- List of open handles to system resource

- Access Token

- PID

- Atleast one thread for execution

Thread is the unit of execution for a process. A thread consists of:

- Contents of CPU Register representing Processor State.

- Two Stacks > one for thread executing in Kernel mode and other for User Mode.

- Private Thread Storage > TLS (Thread Local Storage)

- ID > Thread-ID aka Client-ID

- Can have access tokens in multi-threaded server applications.

Also threads can obtain access tokens and impersonate security context of another process (using FileMapping Object ?)

CONTEXT Block > Thread's local Context

Windows Function - GetThreadContext 

Threads cannot reference address space of another process (can ref. only parent process), unless other process shares its private address space as shared memory (FileMapping Object)

x86/x64 has 4 privilege levels, but Windows use only 2

Ring 0 - Kernel Mode

Ring 3 - User mode

Perf Counters 

Processor / Process / Thread

% Priv Time

% User Time

Kernel Object is a single runtime instance of an object type

An Object Type is a system defined data type.

A process is an instance of a Process Object Type

You can only access an object by its interface.

Registry - performance counters can be accessed by registry.
