**Process Internals**

* Each windows process is represented by a EPROCESS.

* EPROCESS Contains ETHREAD

* EPROCESS exists in System Address space except PEB

* PEB exists in user-mode.

* Each process executing a Win32 Program maintains a parallel CSR_PROCESS. Only windows application have a CSR_PROCESS

* Kernel mode part –Win32k.sys maintains a per-process W32PROCESS structure.

* W32PROCESS – GUI, User/GDI Calls

* Processes are not named objects, and not visible via WinObj.EXE

* These are structures, not contents of the structures. To show an instances, you need to call EPROCESS and specify the address.

**Protected Processes** 

* Any process running with SeDebugPrivilege can request access rights from any other process.

* Protected processes used by

    * Audiodg.exe (DRM implementation ?)

    * WerFault.exe

    * System Process

    * PMP (Protected Media Path) – for high value media. 

Kernel Level Support for Protected Proc

* Bulk of process creation occurs in kernel to avoid injection attacks.

* Protected process have a BIT set in EPROCESS structure

* Only Access rights granted for Protect Process

    * Process Query/Set Limited Information

    * Process Terminate

    * Process Suspend/Resume.

**Flow of CreateProcess**. 

**Stage 1: Converting and Validating Parameters and Flags. **

* Stage before opening the image file.

* Priority Class is specified in Creation Flags Parameter.

* If no desktop is specified then default to current desktop.

* Creation flags specify’s debug, then Kernel32.dll  Call ntdll.dll [API=**_DbgUiConnectToDbg_**]

* Makes initial call to [API=**_NtCreateUserProcess]_**

* Some Attribues

    * PS_CP_PARENT_PROCESS

    * PS_CP_PRIMARY_TOKEN

    * PS_CP_CLIENT_ID

    * PS_CP_FILE_NAME

**Stage 2**: Opening the Image to Be Executed . 373

* If Call fails in Stage 1, return to Stage 1

* Else try to open file using NtCreateUserProcess.

* Check HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options.

* Logic Check Type of Application:

    * Posix

    * Ms-Dos Bat

    * Win16  > ntvdm.exe

    * Windows (.EXE direct)

    * Ms-Dos.Exe .COM, .PIF, .SCR  ntvdm.exe

**Stage 3**: Creating the Windows Executive Process

* NtCreateUserProcess has opened a Windows .EXE and created a section object to map it into process address space.

* Create EPROCESS object to run the image by calling [API=**_PspAllocateProcess]_**

    * **STAGE-3A Setup EPROCESS **

        * Create Process Addr. SpaceING

        * Inherit Parent processing mode.

        * Query Image File Exec Option (reg.key)

        * Disable Stack Randomization if ASLR disabled.

        * Acquire Privileges.

        * Create Process primary access token, the duplicate of parent’s primary token.

        * Set process quota blocks

        * Min/Max WorkingSet is set. Can be overridden with PerfOptions key part of Image File Exe options.

    * **STAGE-3B Create Initial Process Address Space**

        * Create pages

            * Page directory

            * Hyperspace page

        * User process params are written into process.

        * Affinity information written into PEB

        * MinWin API redirection set is mapped.

    * **STAGE-3E Setup PEB**

        * **NtCreateUserProcess** calls **MmCreatePeb**  Maps NLS tables to process address space.

        * Call **MiCreatePebOrTeb** to allocate pages for TEB

        * Evenly spread images on different processors using **MmRotatingUniProcessorNumber**

    * **STAGE-3F Complete Setup of Executive Process Obj (PspInsertProcess)**

        * If auditing enabled, process creation time is written to event log.

        * If parent process was in a job, job is bound to the session of new process.

        * **PspInsertProcess** inserts new process object in **PsActiveProcessHead**

        * **PsPInsertProcess **creates a handle for new process by calling** ObOpenObjectByPointer **and returns handle to caller.

* Call RtlUserThreadStart in ntdll.dll

* Load any required DLLs

* Check NtContinue message and returns to user mode to start thread execution.

**Thread Internals **

A windows thread is represented by an executive thread object. This encapsulates:

ETHREAD, which contains a KTHREAD as its first member.
